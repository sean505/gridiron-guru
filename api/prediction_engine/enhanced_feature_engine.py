Enhanced Feature Engine with High-Impact NFL Features

This module integrates the new high-impact NFL features into the existing
28-feature system while maintaining backward compatibility with trained models.

New Features Integrated:
1. EPA Trends (8 features)
2. Situational Efficiency (9 features) 
3. Turnover and Explosive Plays (10 features)
4. Rest and Travel Factors (9 features)

Total: 36 new features, integrated into 28-feature system by replacing
less important features and combining related metrics.
